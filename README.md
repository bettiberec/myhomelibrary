# My Home Library


My Home Library is a desktop application that lets you build, organize, and manage a virtual personal library.
The project was inspired by my sister, who always dreamed of creating her own home library — but never had enough physical space.
This application brings that idea to life by creating a fully customizable digital bookshelf where books can be added, visualized, rearranged.

The app features a realistic bookshelf, detailed book pages, JSON-based persistence, custom image handling and a drag&drop book rearrangement.
